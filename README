Files:
evaluate.ipynb
 - Start here for a quick demonstration of the ConcreteAbstract class.

concreteabstract.py
 - Contains the code for the ConcreteAbstract class.
 - This is where all the real code is.

documentation.ipynb
 - Documents the code in concreteabstract.py.
 - Read this in conjunction with reading the code

concrete-abstract.ipynb
 - Mostly the same code in the ConcreteAbstract class, but broken down into 
   cells to make testing parts of the code easier.
 - This file may be useful for understanding the code.

explore.ipynb
 - Code where I explore different ideas/tests.
 - You can safely ignore this file.
